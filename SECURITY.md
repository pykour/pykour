# Security Policies and Procedures

This document outlines the security procedures and general policies for the Pykour project.

## Reporting a Bug

The Pykour team takes all security bugs in Pykour seriously.
Thank you for helping us improve the security of Pykour. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure, 
and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security bug, please email the lead maintainer listed in the README.md file.

To ensure a timely response to your report, please include the entirety of the report within the email body and avoid 
using external links or attachments.

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and will follow up with a more detailed response within 
another 48 hours, outlining the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and public 
announcement and may ask for additional information or guidance.

If you discover a security issue in a third-party module used by Pykour, please report it to the person or team 
maintaining that module.

## Pre-release Versions

Alpha and Beta releases are unstable and not suitable for production use. If you find vulnerabilities in pre-release 
versions, please report them according to the “Reporting a Bug” section above.
Due to the unstable nature of these versions, it is not guaranteed that any fixes will be included in the next pre-release.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler.
This handler will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

- Confirm the issue and determine the affected versions. 
- it the code to identify any similar vulnerabilities. 
- pare fixes for all maintained versions. These fixes will be released to PyPI as quickly as possible.
