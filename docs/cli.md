# Pykour CLI

Pykour CLI is a command line program that you can use to serve your Pykour application, manage your Pykour project, and more.

When you install Pykour, it includes a `pykour` command in the terminal.

```bash
$ pykour run main:app
```

### `pykour run`

When you run `pykour run`, it will run on production mode by default.

It will listen on the IP address `0.0.0.0`, which means it will be accessible from any IP address.
